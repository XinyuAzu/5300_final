The triple pendulum problem is in a separate notebook. Due to its complexity I used a totally different method to do that problem. That is, I used sympy first to solve the equation symbolically then plug in initial conditions to simulate instead of constructing class and defining functions.

Three body motion is included in the gravitational orbit notebook (at the end).
